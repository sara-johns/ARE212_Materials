When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",

Next, click **Control Panel** at the top right. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.
